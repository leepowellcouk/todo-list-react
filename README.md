# To Do List - React
Simple 'To Do' list built with JSPM, System.js and React.

*NOTE: This requires at least Node v4.0.0 to run as it makes use of ES6*

To install simply clone this repo to your local environment, fire up a terminal and change directory into the newly cloned root then execute:

     $ npm install

This will then grab all the NPM and JSPM dependencies. Once that's finished run the following:

    $ npm run server:dist

Open up your favourite browser (ideally a Webkit based one) and visit: `http://localhost:8080`

## To Do (no pun intended)

This was a quite a rushed build to play around with React. It could do with a refactor after I have time to read all their documentation.

* Add some tests (should have done this from the start)
* Read up on Flux and their approach to structuring a React app, I can already see that my current approach wouldn't scale very well
* Refactor the data store
